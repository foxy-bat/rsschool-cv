### Summary

I'm a newby in the world of front-end development and very excited to become a part of it. 
I've always been passionate about self education and when I became interested in JS I started my learning process via such sources as https://www.freecodecamp.org/, https://www.codecademy.com/, https://learn.javascript.ru/, etc.
After discovering RS School I realized that it's the opportunity to accept a new challenge and improve my JS level. I'm looking forward to gain new knowledge and acquire the skills needed for future employment.
